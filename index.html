        <p>The major objective of SEA-Hub is to provide basic entrepreneurship training and professional orientation for selected secondary school students in Nigeria starting from o
            ur partner states. The students are taught skills to run a successful business. The SEA-Hub concept fosters opportunity recognition, innovation, risk-taking and critical thinking. The students will also be coached on setting up and effectively managing an entrepreneurship oriented club to be named Students Entrepreneurship Activity Hub (SEA-Hub).
            The students are taught the basics of running a successful business, opportunity, recognition, innovation, risk taking and critical thinking. The students will also be coached on setting up and effectively managing an entrepreneurship oriented club. Entrepreneurship education benefits students from all socioeconomic backgrounds because it teaches teenagers to think outside the box and nurtures unconventional talents and skills. 
            Furthermore, it creates opportunity, ensures social justice, instils confidence and stimulates the economy.</p>

                        Our project"MOLEGE" was made out of eggshells,bottles,ashes,little-detergent and snailshells. MOLEGE is produced to reduce stress when washing of pots,and thick dirty surfaces,it can be made and sold at low cost. MOLEGE can also improve the rate of living and can create new job opportunities in our environment.
